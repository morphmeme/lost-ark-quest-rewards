Adventurers, if you can enter Rohendel, please join us in our efforts to stabilize its magick. Search and Rescue Leader OrlandoStoryRaging Silvery Magick (Points 10)Magick EruptionRohendel, thanks to its abundance in magick, prospers without trading with the outside world.But as it is with everything else, too much is as bad as too little. The Sylvains of Rohendel have to learn how to seal magick to prevent it from overflowing and going into overdrive. A continental traveler's journalUnstable Silvery Magick (Points 20)Cause of Magick EruptionWhen magick rages out of control, it causes tremendous damage to its surroundings.The more serious problem is that no one knows when or where Magick Eruption might occur.The mages of Rohendel have been looking for ways to solve this problem, but in their efforts, they blew up a city named Xeneela. A continental traveler's journalStabilized Silvery Magick (Points 40)Magick Eruption and ElementalsThe elementals are the first ones to sense imminent Magick Eruption. These naturally meek and friendly spirits would go berserk, the moment it occurs, attacking everything that they see. A continental traveler's journalRampaging Xeneelan Magick (Points 80)Xeneela and RothunThere are not many places on the Rohendel continent, let alone in the world, that can contain the magick released from the World Tree Elzowin. And Xeneela and Rothun had the most stable flow of magick among them all.The Sylvain queens, Azena and Inanna, each built a city in these places, and under their leadership and with the blessing of Elzowin's magick, the Sylvain cities prospered. ErvantesUnstable Xeneelan Magick (Points 150)The Sun and the MoonMage Ealyn, whom I met in Moonkeep, told me an interesting story. She wanted to better utilize Xeneela's magick.At the time, I didn't know what kind of price Xeneela would have to pay for her ambition. ErvantesStable Xeneelan Mana (Points 150)Strange FriendsAs far as I remember, that fateful day wasn't different from any other day before it. As usual, I woke up to the sound of small birds singing, and ate some pitted Hollowfruit for breakfast. Then, I felt a slight vibration and everything went black. When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the cold ground. I stood up and looked around. Xeneela was in shambles.What do I do now?

Adventurers, if you can enter Rohendel, please join us in our efforts to stabilize its magick. Search and Rescue Leader OrlandoStoryRaging Silvery Magick (Points 10)Magick EruptionRohendel, thanks to its abundance in magick, prospers without trading with the outside world.But as it is with everything else, too much is as bad as too little. The Sylvains of Rohendel have to learn how to seal magick to prevent it from overflowing and going into overdrive. A continental traveler's journalUnstable Silvery Magick (Points 20)Cause of Magick EruptionWhen magick rages out of control, it causes tremendous damage to its surroundings.The more serious problem is that no one knows when or where Magick Eruption might occur.The mages of Rohendel have been looking for ways to solve this problem, but in their efforts, they blew up a city named Xeneela. A continental traveler's journalStabilized Silvery Magick (Points 40)Magick Eruption and ElementalsThe elementals are the first ones to sense imminent Magick Eruption. These naturally meek and friendly spirits would go berserk, the moment it occurs, attacking everything that they see. A continental traveler's journalRampaging Xeneelan Magick (Points 80)Xeneela and RothunThere are not many places on the Rohendel continent, let alone in the world, that can contain the magick released from the World Tree Elzowin. And Xeneela and Rothun had the most stable flow of magick among them all.The Sylvain queens, Azena and Inanna, each built a city in these places, and under their leadership and with the blessing of Elzowin's magick, the Sylvain cities prospered. ErvantesUnstable Xeneelan Magick (Points 150)The Sun and the MoonMage Ealyn, whom I met in Moonkeep, told me an interesting story. She wanted to better utilize Xeneela's magick.At the time, I didn't know what kind of price Xeneela would have to pay for her ambition. ErvantesStable Xeneelan Mana (Points 150)Strange FriendsAs far as I remember, that fateful day wasn't different from any other day before it. As usual, I woke up to the sound of small birds singing, and ate some pitted Hollowfruit for breakfast. Then, I felt a slight vibration and everything went black. When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the cold ground. I stood up and looked around. Xeneela was in shambles.What do I do now?

We look forward to the participation of the foreigners!Veteran Surfer Shore StoryNovice Surfer (Points 80)Memoirs of the Legendary Surfer EdnaI will never forget the day when I first learned surfing. I had just learnt how to read the waves from my mother. The chief took a hold of me when I lost balance and smiled gently at me. The white gleaming sunlight behind her. Everything was perfect about that day. The little surfing board my mother gave into my little hands still resides in the corner of my room, watching over me warmly.Veteran Surfer (Points 120)Memoirs of the Legendary Surfer EdnaI feel so free when I'm riding the waves as high as the Nia Village itself, everything becomes so insignificant. I feel as if I were the only one left on this vast sea. The solitude. That solitude washes my worries away like the blue waves washing away the stars in front of me.Reputation 1 Level Reward","102k","Reputation 2 Level Reward","153k"]},{quest_id:"ID:

Search and Rescue's Disaster and Safety BranchStoryThe Patients' Friend (Points 10)Remaining PatientsThe plague spread by the Demons affected many victims, but it eventually died out, thanks to the monks of the Regria Monastery and an able adventurer.Those whom they saved from the brink of death could not have been more grateful. Historical recordsThe Patients' Patron (Points 20)Patience and DedicationThe plague had abated, but some of its victims were just too weak to make a full recovery on their own. They were getting more fatigued by the day, but an adventurer tirelessly tended them until they were well again.Never had an adventurer been so patient or dedicated to ailing people; truly, this level of care came from the bottom of the adventurer's heart. Historical recordsThe Patients' Savior (Points 40)The Jade and Its MiracleSome say the Serpentine Jade was instrumental in the treatment of the plague.In truth it only helped develop the cure. If it weren't for the people who nursed the plague victims back to health, no records of this miracle would have been left for future generations to read.

It must be difficult being a chauffeur every day, but this is nothing.There comes a day when you're old enough that you're just thankful you can work.When I was young, I was upset I couldn't do other things because I had to earn money.But when you get old and people don't want you, you have plenty of time.But to enjoy the time you have, you have to spend money.

Old Man of Croconys Fishing VillageStoryGhost Ship Infiltrator (Points 30)LifeDestroyersEven pirates find a truely valuable treasure maybe once in their entire lifetime.You have to be careful of those days. If you count how many drowned at sea versus how many were stabbed after a mutiny, which one do you think is more numerous?That ship sunk for that ordinary reason.It's said there was a mutiny the day they found treasure. The captain changed and the slowwitted were all killed.The original owner of the ship was tied to the anchor. Before the anchor was lowered, the man that led the mutiny asked for his last words.The owner of the ship laughed and told them the value of the treasure. The pirates' eyes lit up.Well, after that, yes, let's see,the person that took control of the ship wasAguis,. Or was it Alford?Ghost Ship Conqueror (Points 40)Legend of the White AshIt was very long ago. Way before Bloodclaw even ruled over the seas.About 200 years ago, there was a ship loved by the sea.The people of the land saw him as the king of the sea. Even the wind over the sea was at his side.He also believed it. That there is no other owner of the seas but him, Vyoshka.The witch Sarahiel told him a secret. There is a treasure in the forbidden sea that the owner of the sea must aquire.The treasure that nobody could get to is now his.He didn't hesitate. He put together the most reliable crew and prepared for a long voyage.And he became \"White Ash.\"Like the name of the ship.Many people remember White Ash, the ship loved by the sea that must have reached the treasure.Where is it now? When will the sea let go of her beloved ship?Master of Ghost Ship (Points 50)EibernCaptain, where are you going?You didn't answer when I asked you.You drank a glass of wine and looked out the window with a lonely expression.Did you see the ocean or a forlorn longing?The day the ship came back alone from the storm, people didn't call me.It's probably because they knew I would weep.After the rain stopped, and I saw your ship floating calmly on the glittering sea,I wept and I wept again.My tears didn't dry up andI wept,and I wept.You mademe cry like that.Did you want to leave me like that? Where were you running off to?You can't leave that ship, but how could you leave me?I couldn't trust that empty ship and wandered aimlessly between souls.And so, I encased it into a glass bottle, so that not a single soul can leave the ship.There's so many, but you are the only one who's not here, your soul, your shadow, your voice.I scream your name and sing our song alone.The way I look scares even me. Were you scared of me, too?I was just a woman dreaming beside you after falling asleep, listening to the waves.It's not important if you're alive.I will find you, and I hope we will never be separated again.Reputation 1 Level Reward","7000","Reputation 2 Level Reward","10000","Reputation 3 Level Reward","12k"]},{quest_id:"ID: 4002605",quest_name:"She Drifts, Sea Gifts",rewards:["1080 Roster XP ","10 Reputation Points","5 Harmony Leapstone (Bound) ("," 0 ~ 379)","5 Harmony Leapstone (Bound) ("," 380 ~ 459)","8 Harmony Leapstone (Bound) ("," 460 ~ 539)","8 Harmony Leapstone (Bound) ("," 540 ~ 801)","5 Life Leapstone (Bound) ("," 802 ~ 879)","5 Life Leapstone (Bound) ("," 880 ~ 959)","8 Life Leapstone (Bound) ("," 960 ~ 1039)","8 Life Leapstone (Bound) ("," 1040 ~ 1301)","4 Honor Leapstone (Bound) ("," 1302 ~ 1324)","4 Honor Leapstone (Bound) ("," 1325 ~ 1369)","4 Great Honor Leapstone (Bound) ("," 1370+)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 802 ~ 879)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 880 ~ 959)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 960 ~ 1039)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1040 ~ 1301)","2 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1302 ~ 1324)","5 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1325 ~ 1369)","5 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1370+)","Reputation Status ","StoryPirate Star AstrayDescriptionThey say don't trust anybody and you're trusting a pirate?

Oh, and be careful of the cannons.Pirate's Savior (Points 80)Red DoomThe rulers of the four seas reigned over the waters, each with their own beliefs and rules.The most scary and dangerous among them was weird, I can't remember his real name.But you can't forget his nickname. Have you heard of the Red Doom?He's a scary guy who rules over pirates with curses and necromancy.Where his curse passes, only beings crusted with barnacles and starfish are left behind.Even Ed the Red who invaded Tortoyk was cursed by him.I never saw him in person.But they say that contrary to his scary personality, his appearance is of a Sylvain.You can never know for sure. A Sylvain, a magical race, doing piracy.Oh now I remember Narkiel. It's Red Doom Narkiel.If you meet him, be careful. There's rumors that it was him that attacked the great pirate Bloodclaw.Star of the Night Sea (Points 120)Missing Great PirateIt's already a decade ago. When the damaged ship of the great pirate floated ashore of a southern country,it was terrible. The ship was covered in blood and there was only one survivor.Unfortunately, Bloodclaw wasn't there. Neither among the living or the dead.The survivor couldn't talk and the gossip of this incident spread like the waves.It seems there were no other clues left by Bloodclaw.He sent some of his crew away at a critical momentso doesn't it seem like there was Bloodclaw's treasure on the ship?Then, did plunderers kill everybody and take the treasure?Reputation 1 Level Reward","12k","Reputation 2 Level

Heights, studying the amnesiac ghosts there. This icy cliff in the northern area is very dangerous.Could you go to the frozen cliff on the Shushire continent and support Archaeologist Alkke? Gideon, the master of Ignea, the Adventurer's GuildStoryArke's Research Assistant (Points 30)Amnesiac GhostI've encountered a ghost with no memories of its past on the notoriously dangerous Icewing Heights. Is it of a Shushire fighter? Can I learn about its past if I collect its memories scattered around the Icewing Heights? Arke's Research Journal Icewing HeightsArke's Research Supporter (Points 40)Fragments of MemoriesI've studied the ghosts while collecting the fragments of their memories. These wandering ghosts are obsessed with their scattered past, as if trying to find what they left behind when they were alive. It would be worth noting that the ghosts are driven not by materials such as flesh and bones, but by treasures of the mind memories.Arke's Research Journal Icewing HeightsArke's Research Colleague (Points 80)Frozen MemoriesThe Icewing Heights are always cold and steep. It's so cold that perhaps even immaterial memories turn into frozen icicles. If it was warm, the ghosts might have melted and resumed the cycle of life and death. But everything on this cliff gets frozen and halted. So the ghosts continue to roam about it, not knowing where to go next.

Numerous archeologists have gathered to excavate the relics of Encavia, but there are many who have nefarious intentions. I'm talking about the illicit marketeers who intend to smuggle the relics. I heard they've been trading relics on Freedom Isle recently. To help the archeologists, we need to catch the Illicit Marketeers who have snuck onto Freedom Isle. Ignea Guildmaster GideonStoryExcavating Supporter (Points 30)False ArchaeologistEncavia is a kingdom that disappeared into the ground one night. To discover her secrets, archeologists from all over the world are gathering at Yudia. But there are some who have a different purpose to pilfer the valuable relics. They steal the excavated relics in secret and disappear under the cover of the night. According to an anonymous report, they are trading the ancient relics on Freedom Isle.Shadow Over Freedom Isle False ArchaeologistAvid Excavating Supporter (Points 40)Freedom Isle and the Illicit Market MerchantTo a sailor, Freedom Isle is like an oasis in the middle of the desert. This is because the Blackfang Pirates, with their flagship the Black Fox, keep the smaller pirates away from the island's waters. The illicit marketeers are taking advantage of this. They appear out of thin air to sell their wares, then disappear among the other traders as soon as they notice the slightest sign of danger. Shadow Over Freedom Isle Illicit MarketPassionate Excavating Supporter (Points 80)Archaeologist Allied with the PiratesThe archeologists tried many different ways to recover their stolen relics. Some hired mercenaries while others ventured to the island themselves to catch the illicit marketeers. But the result of their efforts has been negligible. At their wit's end, the archeologists asked for the help of the ruler of Freedom Isle, the Blackfang Pirates. As the Illicit Market had been a thorn in the Blackfang Pirates' side, they readily accepted the proposal, and this marked the first time when the archeologists and pirates formed an alliance.Shadow Over Freedom Isle Pirates and ArchaeologistsReputation 1 Level Reward","5000","Reputation 2 Level Reward","7000","Reputation 3 Level Reward","14k"]},{quest_id:"ID: 5027901",quest_name:"Much Ado About Chickens",rewards:[" 15~450"]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028103",quest_name:"Becoming an Idol",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028104",quest_name:"The Future Is in Our Hands",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028105",quest_name:"The Girl with Starlit Eyes",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028106",quest_name:"The Ship's Magician",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028107",quest_name:"Want to See My Hat Trick?",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028108",quest_name:"Time for a Takedown",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028109",quest_name:"Finally Finished",rewards:[]},{quest_id:"ID: 5028601",quest_name:"A Hard Day at Work",rewards:["1080 Roster XP ","10 Reputation Points"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 802 ~ 879)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 880 ~ 959)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 960 ~ 1039)"," Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1040 ~ 1301)","2 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1302 ~ 1324)","5 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1325 ~ 1369)","5 Small Combat XP Potion ("," 1370+)","Reputation Status ",'StoryPeytoDescriptionYou\'ve been on the Peyto, haven\'t you?

While we already have requests for culling their numbers, we also have another request to use them for creating a new dish. Once we succeed in cooking the slimes, it will greatly reduce the slimes everywhere else. We look forward to your active interest in this matter. Ignea Guildmaster GideonStorySlime Chef (Points 30)Chef's AdviceCooking involves various techniques. Preparing ingredients and cooking them are just two of them.Don't be disappointed, even if your slime food didn't work out. You can always try a different way of preparing them. If boiling doesn't work, then try grilling.Never give up trying. New food is sometimes a happy accident. Poem's Cooking SecretsSkilled Slime Chef (Points 40)Chef's CaveatsThere are few things that you must know before you cook slimes. 1. Make sure they're at least unconscious, or ideally, dead. Living, conscious slimes are difficult to handle, and they can also suffocate anyone who eats them.2. Watch out for any accidents while grilling or boiling slimes. Sometimes they squirm, causing cooking fires.3. Use different spices based on the viscosity of your slimes. Following a recipe to a tee without considering the characteristics of your slimes can create an unappetizing dish. Poem's Cooking SecretsSlime Food Expert (Points 80)Chef's TeachingsIt's not easy cooking slimes, but there are several benefits to it, the biggest one being the innovative usage of the main ingredient. Just the fact that you're using such an unconventional ingredient can help revolutionize our culinary culture.It will undoubtedly take more time and research for slime to become a popular ingredient, but who knows? Maybe some gourmets have already developed a palate for its unique texture. This is not to mention the benefit of slime huntingwhich can slow their abnormal reproduction rate, and help curb their populationsince it's not within my area of expertise.

She's testing some products on people to become the best alchemist in the world, and she apparently needs an assistant. She's called Lychel, and specifically requested you. Since it seems like you two know each other, why don't you help her out? Maybe she'll be able to release her new reagent sooner if you do. The Zenlord, master of Carpus the Shadow of the SunStoryAssistant (Points 50)Clandestine Reagent ExperimentI tried adjusting the amount of light powder, but it still gives the same wave measurement. I thought the ratio is what's important for conversion?I can't focus on making this reagent because of people coming in and out of the alchemy workshop. I bet they're going to see that old hag, Carat! What's so good about her stuff? It all looks so boring to me. Lychel's Experiment Journal Why is there no conversion? Excellent Assistant (Points 70)Grim Reagent ExperimentFinally, the reagent is giving out various waves! I learned that it's not just the ratio of the light powder, but also the mixing timing. Now, I just need to change the values of the wavelengths and create a proper version. Then maybe I'll get something that can change another object's vibration! Once I manage that, it's not just a pipe dream to change someone else's feelings. Love potion, confidence potion, I'll be able to make anything! Everyone will go crazy over my potions and I'm going to be rich!I can imagine granny Carat just dying to bring my great inventions into the workshop. Imagine that, her begging me to let her sell my stuff! Just thinking about it makes me happy. I'm going to keep researching and show Carat how great I am! Lychel's Experiment Journal I can see hope Great Assistant (Points 100)Amazing Reagent ExperimentI decided to further structure the reagent development. I thought I could convert anything by just changing the wavelength, but that only changes the appearance, not the inherent properties! I can't make a potion that can change someone else's mind with this. First, I should look into restoring a mind clouded by the effect of the body or the environment.Although I hit a snag in my research, I'm not going to give up. I'll keep working until I finally achieve my goals. That's the spirit of alchemy that Lakka wrote about in his book! Lakka is a great alchemist, just like me. I bet that granny Carat's reagent doesn't even come close to even a drop of his stuff!Once I get a useful result, I plan to proceed to mass production. I hope that my assistant will continue to help me. PlayerI thought he would just do a halfhearted job for a few days and leave. I wasn't expecting him to do such a good job. I thought he might be sick of gathering ingredients day after day, but never got angry at me. He didn't treat me like an idiot, even when my research made no progress. Above all, he never compared me with granny Carat. What a great guy. Once I succeed, I'm going to make sure he gets a nice cut of the profits.

We need help inspecting incoming vessels to prevent the trafficking of endangered wild animals and plants. The merchant community already knows the faces and physical characteristics of all our guildmates.We need someone they've never seen before. If you're interested, please come to Atropos Island. Search and Rescue's Environment and Ecology BranchStoryHawk Eye (Points 10)Report on Endangered Animal and Plant TraffickingRecently, the populations of endangered animals have been plummeting, due to indiscriminate poaching. Endangered plants are similarly being indiscriminately collected and spread to other locales, causing disruptions to both ecosystems. These situations are only getting so dire because of greedy poachers and smugglers. Paragon's Environmental Protection Strategist ErchoKeen Hawk Eye (Points 20)Reasons for Endangered Animal and Plant TraffickingThere are various reasons for the trafficking of endangered animals and plants. Some people want rare fur coats. Some people want rare pets. Some people want to decorate their gardens with rare plants. Most of the reasons are based on people's desires for status and luxury, which makes the trafficking all the more serious an issue. Paragon's Environmental Protection Strategist ErchoKeen Hawk Eye (Points 40)Solutions for Endangered Animal and Plant TraffickingIt's meaningful that Atropos Island, an agent of intercontinental trading, is inspecting ships for illegal animal and plant trafficking. But it can't be the only place where animals and plants are smuggled in. There have to be longterm solutions to prevent the systematical and customary trafficking of endangered species. But realistically, it's not feasible to prohibit their trading worldwide. So, for now, I commend the staff of Atropos Island for its effort to stop it on its own.

The Zenlord, master of Carpus the Shadow of the SunStoryTooki (Points 10)Tooki Corporation IntroductionWhen I first entered Tooki Corporation, I remember seeing a notice. It said,\"Tooki Corporation makes a sparkling world for everyone. Tooki Corporation, with the bond between Tookies, is built on the spirit of sharing knowledge on gathering shiny things and mutual respect. We hope to become a continuously growing company that can help Tookies throughout Arkesia spread their brilliance and become happy.\"It's pretty cheesy, but isn't it admirable? It was really impressive for a new Tooki like me. Ah, I don't have to be all alone anymore when I collect shiny things. I can work together with other Tookies and collect even more stuff. Thinking that way really gave me hope.But one day, I realized that it was nothing but a fool's errand, all just empty words. Tooki 77's Remembrance During My Early DaysDiligent Tooki (Points 30)Tooki Corporation and HappinessI collected shiny things as best I could and took advancement tests diligently. Even after I did well on the tests, I was always worried that I didn't have enough twinkles. I really worked hard to get more treasures back then. I ran away from adventurers that were after my stuff and went through all sorts of trouble to do well.But, as it turns out, I wouldn't get that promotion just because I worked hard. I had to collect more than the others, last longer than others. Isn't that funny? I thought they wanted to collect shiny things together. That we could be happy together. If I were to get my promotion, other Tookies next to me had to fail. If I were to become happy, other Tookies had to become unhappy. How can we all achieve happiness like that? How can we become happy when all that matters is competition? The happiness that the Tooki Corporation talks aboutis it really about happiness of the Tookies? Is it the kind of happiness that the average Tooki, working hard every day to gather more stuff, can achieve? Is it? Tooki 77's Question Can We Really Be Happy Together?Devoted Tooki (Points 50)Tooki Corporation's TruthOnce I began to doubt the message, I began asking questions about the corporation. Why is this place called the Tooki Corporation? What is a corporation? It's a place created from the small bits of twinkles that many Tookies put together. Of the twinkles, by the twinkles, for the twinkles. The more twinkles you put into Tooki Tooki's pocket, the more twinkles you get.But something was off. Expenses, shareseveryone's talking about it all the time, but no one really knows what they are! They keep putting twinkles into the pocket, but no one knows where and how the twinkles are collected, and who's using the twinkles!So I started investigating. Since when was this island called Tooki Corporation? Why wasn't it Tooki Treasure Island, or Home of the Tookies? Why \"corporation?\" I found out the following from my investigation.1. Shares are never used together with twinkles.2. On the island where the merchants gather, shares are mentioned very rarely.3. The word corporation is never connected with twinkles. Apparently a Tooki heard a similar word on an island called Lopang.4. A certain Tooki started using the word \"corporation\" after hearing and liking it. That Tooki apparently didn't know much about merchants or Lopang. He just liked it.Number 4this one was the most baffling. We just started using the word \"corporation\" because someone liked how it sounded, without knowing what shares or companies are. I know that we are a bit too obsessed with twinkles and don't pay much attention to other things, but isn't this a bit much? Tooki 77's Realization The Origin of the Word \"Corporation\"Serious Tooki (Points 70)Tooki Corporation and ShininessAfter realizing that were named after some random word without any sort of connection to those fancy terms like shares or expenses, I actually felt more relieved. I didn't obsess over my number. I began to take the whole collecting business easy. Just enough to get by.After all, Tooki Corporation's shininess has nothing to do with things like shares or expenses, right? Then things like passion or sense of duty or hard work that Tooki Corporation likes so muchthey have nothing to do with the real thing.After I accepted that, I found my twodigit position wasn't so bad. There's no reason to work so hard, no need to take on so much responsibility. A number perfect for taking things easy. I don't know how my twinkles get used, whether they just get added to a big pile on the island or go into the hands of the singledigit Tookies. But that's not really important, is it?All I need to do is just collect the twinkles like all proper Tookies do, and bring them back here. I decided to not think too hard about it or put too much effort into it. So, don't pay too much attention to things like passion or sense of duty. Maybe those things just tarnish the real shininess in our minds and our hope to live an honest life.

Just enough to get by.After all, Tooki Corporation's shininess has nothing to do with things like shares or expenses, right? Then things like passion or sense of duty or hard work that Tooki Corporation likes so muchthey have nothing to do with the real thing.After I accepted that, I found my twodigit position wasn't so bad. There's no reason to work so hard, no need to take on so much responsibility. A number perfect for taking things easy. I don't know how my twinkles get used, whether they just get added to a big pile on the island or go into the hands of the singledigit Tookies. But that's not really important, is it?All I need to do is just collect the twinkles like all proper Tookies do, and bring them back here. I decided to not think too hard about it or put too much effort into it. So, don't pay too much attention to things like passion or sense of duty. Maybe those things just tarnish the real shininess in our minds and our hope to live an honest life.

the freerange rabbits he raises.Your... active participation will be appreciated. Gideon, the master of Ignea, the Adventurer's GuildStoryOne, Two, Three (Points 10)Results of FreeRange RearingThanks to you, the client's rabbits have grown big and healthy. Perhaps because of these freerange rabbits, however, the numbers of rabbits in the forests around Changhun has been increasing at an alarming rate.Don't worry, though. We're also specialized in problems like that. A letter from Ignea Guildmaster GideonTwo, Two, Three (Points 20)Pros of FreeRange RearingDo you know the difference between freerange rabbits and farmed rabbits? The former have stronger hind legs and glossier fur.The same goes for people. Those who get around are healthier and more flexible than those who stay cooped up in one place. You're a good example yourself.By the way, rabbits reproduce way faster than I thought. A letter from Ignea Guildmaster GideonThree, Two, Three (Points 40)Outcomes of FreeRange RearingThe rabbits are growing numerous, but don't worry. This Arkesia is big enough to accommodate all of them.Changhun alone is bigger than you think. Don't worry about them, and keep up the good work carrying out requests.

SoulsDescriptionThis is an ongoing request from the Regulus Order of the Kadan Cathedral.The energy of the Demons sealed under the cathedral is growing stronger, transforming the spirits of the dead in the catacombs into angry ghosts.The Order performs exorcisms to put those spirits to rest again, and it wants us to join them in this work. Please go see High Priest Mikhaila. Ignea Guildmaster GideonStoryExorcist (Points 10)The Exorcist\'s MemoirsThe child was smiling innocently. I would\'ve mistaken him for a real child if it weren\'t for his semitransparent body. I sprayed holy water on him. "Arrrggghh! It burns! Curse you! I curse you!" Writhing dark energy covered the child and revealed the evil spirit in him. I sprayed more holy water and called the spirit by name three times. "Kaimorax! Kaimorax! Kaimorax!" The spirit writhed and scattered like dust. The spirit of the child was visible again, lying on the ground. After a time, he stood up and spoke in a halfdazed voice, "Thank you..." Memories of the Exorcist Chapter 1Light Exorcist (Points 20)The Exorcist\'s MemoirsThe possessed woman let out an earsplitting scream. Her voice rang in my ears like a terrible nightmare, and I battled the Demons, desperate to silence her screaming. "Die... Die... Die already!" Barely able to withstand the sounds emanating from either her or mefor I could no longer tellI withdrew holy water and poured it on her. Once, twice, three times. The nightmarish sounds abated with each pour. After a moment of silence, I heard a gentle, dreamy whisper. "I think I can rest now..." Memories of the Exorcist Chapter 2Brilliant Exorcist (Points 40)The Exorcist\'s MemoirsThe air reeked with the smell of blood. The Demons were drawn to the coppery stench, and the more they slaughtered, the more blood was spilled, and the stronger the stench became. "This place calls us," they crowed. \'War begets carnage, carnage blood, and blood hatred..." But I heard another voice, and I poured holy water onto the bloodiest mass of ravaged flesh. As the gore washed away, a form revealed itself a Luterran knight, who then spoke to me, saying "Thank you for bringing peace to Luterra... and to me."

Butler Hahn of the Moronto Family and Port Merchant Guildmaster Onesis work together to maintain the order and safety of the Port.It seems they've been shortstaffed of late. If the King's Knight steps in, the Port Guard, the merchants, and everyone who travels the continent from the Port will feel much safer, don't you think? Gideon, the master of Ignea, the Adventurer's GuildStoryMoronto's Agent (Points 10)About Butler HahnHahn, the butler of the Moronto Family, has assisted Cals in overseeing his family's affairs for a long time. People who know him halfjokingly say he would've made a great diplomat or politician if he'd entered the political world. But Hahn, just like his ancestors, has no ambition outside of being the butler for the Morontos. The People of Luterra Wavestrand PortGuildmaster's Acquaintance (Points 20)About Guildmaster OnesisGuildmaster Onesis is the daughter of a fallen business tycoon. Her father owned a big trading company that did business between Rethramis and Luterra. He and his merchants were attacked and slaughtered by a giant worm while crossing the desert of Yudia. Onesis was alone in her mansion at the foot of Mount Zagoras when she heard the news. For several hours, she glared in the direction of the vast desert, then she went out to sea on the same day. It's said that since that day, she hasn't set foot on land outside Wavestrand Port. The People of Luterra Wavestrand PortSilver Lion (Points 40)About Hahn and Onesis's cooperationIt's not clear how the Moronto Family's butler, Hahn, and Merchant Guildmaster Onesis have decided to work together. Some say Onesis's father was a supplier of the Morontos for a long time. Others say Onesis is a friend to a Moronto girl. Others again say Hahn took notice of Onesis's executive ability. Whatever the reason, it doesn't change the fact that they've joined forces to promote fair trade at Wavestrand Port.

Innkeeper Margo StoryIn Remembrance of Those Who Are Gone (Points 60)TargoThere is only one Spider Queen in the valley. Always one.Killing it is pointless since another one soon takes its place.I believe that the death of a queen causes a common spider to mutate into one.To get rid of them, all spiders in the valley must be killed.Do you think it's possible?Look, so long as it's killed before it becomes too big to handle, it's fine.But this one was pretty tough.Anyway, Danto and Levi...They almost screwed up the mission because of a damn spider.Back in my day... Retired Member Kyle In Remembrance of Those Who Are Gone (Points 60)VakondaBack then, our village got pretty busy during the Vakonda hunting season.We reinforced other members' armors and crafted ropes and large sacks to help them with carrying the meat.Everyone worked as equals.Then, at night, we listened to the songs of the Bonfire Keeper, and counted the stars in the night sky together.Maybe one day, we might live in peace and wealth, like the people in the outside world,but I think I will still miss the taste of Vakonda meat. Inn Guest Hios In Remembrance of Those Who Are Gone (Points 80)Ancestor Blue CrowI heard that he was calm like a cat during the ascension ritual.Yet to hear that he acted like he always does, even while using the Chaos Fragment...Normally, the Blue Crows, when they use their power, feel a paralyzing pain and become increasingly unstable.That's why the most skilled individuals keep watch over them.But apparently, he didn't even show a single sign of becoming corrupted.His mental state was perfectly stable.It was as if he was born to use the power of the Fragment.But that all changed one day.His father became corrupted and ran away from the village.I think his mind just broke after hearing that news.In the blink of an eye he went berserk.He slaughtered every Avesta member he saw.Zaika himself had to step in to put him down.Sigh... Poor kid.If only he weren't born as a Blue Crow... Inn Guest Zedna In Remembrance of Those Who Are Gone (Points 80)ZaikaWe wouldn't even be here if not for him.Our entire race would have perished centuries ago at the hands of the Holy Sacrian Empire.Right after the end of the Chain War, our people suffered even more hostility than it does today.No matter where we went, we were treated like despicable Demons.To survive, we Delains had to band together, and the one who achieved that was Zaika.Although the ones who rejected his rules of restraint left to join Kurzan...

Fortune Teller Kinsera StoryWatcher Soul Guide (Points 50)FutureThe future is like a dancing flame, and I feel the same way about that person.One day, he will come back. Perhaps I continue to tell fortunes in anticipation of that day.I've seen him once before, on the day I first became a fortune teller.Do you know me?He did not recognize me.So, I answered no.After all, our first meeting needs to be much later. Fortune Teller Kinsera Watcher Soul Mourner (Points 50)PresentFeiton went through so much.They will lose their lord, who has sacrificed everything to protect the land for centuries.They will step out of his shadow, and have their own little adventures in the world.We were born from the darkness. It makes the light shine even brighter.The thirst for light... Heheheh.. That is the fate of the poor Delains. Fortune Teller Kinsera Old Watcher's Rememberer (Points 50)PastHehehehehe! Well, it's been a while since I saw you.I will tell you an old story.There are ordinary...well, no. Let's say \"foolish.\" Foolish people who follow their loved ones or families to the settlement village.Now, on one particular day, something was off. All the previously unstable people became corrupted. Not only the one she followed, but the lady who waved at her in the morning, the kid she ate lunch with, and the neighbor she just smiled at... Terrified out of her mind, she took the red medicine. But somehow she survived and found herself atop a mountain of corpses. A gift from the Avesta. She was haunted. Something had gone terribly wrong.Such misfortune really did fall upon just one woman.

Investigator NeredinStoryNoble Monk (Points 30)History of Feiton Origin of HatredAfter the Chain War, halfDemon, halfHuman hybrid races were born.Their bodies were like Demons, and they could wield the power of Chaos.Arkesia's races immediately expressed hostility towards the new race.The hatred and fear of the Demons remained fresh in their minds.But the most hostile of them all was the Holy Empire Sacria.Pure Monk (Points 50)History of Feiton MassacreSacria claimed that the Demon's seeds must be removed from Arkesia.Under the pretense of a divine mission, they committed a mass genocide.The other nations simply watched.But they did not resist, despite having the power of Demons.Instead, they called themselves Delains, \"the abandoned.\"They then headed towards the cursed land, Feiton.Innocent Monk (Points 70)History of Feiton Restraint and ChaosFeiton's Delains tried to suppress their Demonic powers through training.Failure to do so turned them into fullfledged Demons, but they believed that one day, their strength would be needed.So they made it their divine mission to follow the path of restraint.But, of course, not everyone did.Some cursed Sacria for forcing them to become Demons, and many didn't bother to even try to hide their Demonic powers.Their ideological rift became deeper and deeper, and the Delains were split into two factions.Those who chose Chaos left to Kurzan, waiting for the return of the archdemon.Reputation 1 Level Reward","25k","Reputation 2 Level Reward","42k2","Reputation 3 Level Reward","59k33"]},{quest_id:"ID:
