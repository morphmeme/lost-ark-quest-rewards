I had just learnt how to read the waves from my mother. The chief took a hold of me when I lost balance and smiled gently at me. The white gleaming sunlight behind her. Everything was perfect about that day. The little surfing board my mother gave into my little hands still resides in the corner of my room, watching over me warmly.Veteran Surfer (Points 120)Memoirs of the Legendary Surfer EdnaI feel so free when I'm riding the waves as high as the Nia Village itself, everything becomes so insignificant. I feel as if I were the only one left on this vast sea. The solitude. That solitude washes my worries away like the blue waves washing away the stars in front of me.Reputation 1 Level Reward102kReputation 2 Level Reward153k"]},{quest_id:"ID: 1201603",quest_name:"Fish
